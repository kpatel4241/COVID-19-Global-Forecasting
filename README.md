COVID-19 Global Forecasting using XGBoost
==========================================
This problem involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. Itâ€™s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.

In this problem, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates.
